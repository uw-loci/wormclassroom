<ul>
   <li>Who first introduced (invented) this technique? (a bit of history about its discovery)</li>
   <li>What is crossing? How does it work? (the mechanism: such as RNAi to block RNA translation)</li>
   <li>Selfing (hermaphrodite self-fertilization)&nbsp;is one form of crossing</li>
   <li>Why is it used (when to use it to produce what consequences? to study what?)</li>
   <li>How is it done? (methodology)</li>
   <li>How much time does it take?</li>
   <li>Advantage or disadvantage to use such technique in research</li>
