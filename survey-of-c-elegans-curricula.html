<!-- Survey of C. elegans Curricula (1999) -->

<p>Morgan (1999) noted that "Many of the features that make <em>C. elegans</em> an excellent research organism - its small size, rapid life cycle, and ease of cultivation - also make it useful for undergraduate instruction, including courses in genetics, developmental biology, and molecular biology." While<em> C. elegans</em> is popularly used in research laboratories, its use is increasing in education.</p>
<p>At the 12th <em>C. elegans</em> Meeting, a teaching workshop was held for educators who use <em>C. elegans</em> in their classrooms. During the meeting, the teachers exchanged their experiences, including how to provoke students' interest in science. A poster session was held after the teaching workshop, where educators displayed and discussed how they have incorporated <em>C. elegans</em> into their curricula. After the meeting, I met with most of these <em>C. elegans</em> educators, discussed how they used <em>C. elegans</em>, and obtained their permission to include descriptions of their use in my project.</p>
