In *C. elegans*, most workers are working on comparative developmental
biology. As a result, they take advantage of all of the normal tools of
*C. elegan*s developmental biology and also try to apply them to related
nematodes: forward genetic screens to identify processes in an unbiased
manner, gene knock down techniques like RNAi and morpholino oligo
injections to investigate the function of specific genes and pathways
regardless of the biological functions they are involved in, and
traditional cell manipulations such as laser ablations to identify
cell-cell interactions. Additionally, worm evolutionary biologists also
must use genomics and morphological studies of related nematodes to
construct a phylogenetic tree so that changes can be placed in context
with the histories of the related worms.

Recently, in addition to developmental studies, researchers have made
inroads into incorporating nematode ecology with their development.
Integrating developmental programs, environmental cues, and selective
pressures remains one of the most difficult and least understood topics
in biology. This is of particular importance as the laboratory
environment in which nematodes are studied is not the same as their
natural habitat.

It is difficult to correlate experimental effects observed in laboratory
animals to the effects the same genetic or cell manipulations would have
in the wild. These studies involve collecting new nematode strains in
field experiments, monitoring sex ratios and population distributions
with respect to life-stages in the wild, determining where nematodes
really live and their natural food sources, and determining their
relationships with naturally occurring hosts, symbiotes, and pathogens.
