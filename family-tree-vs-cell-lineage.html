<!-- Family Tree vs. Cell Lineage
 -->
<p>Think about the development of a human family tree, cells inside <em>C. elegans</em> and even cells inside your body. What are the similarities and differences between them?</p>
<p>Please observe the two movies below and come up with your observations and questions for discussion.</p>
<h2>Trace Back A Family Tree</h2>
<p>Here is an <strong>example <span style="color: #660000;"><span style="color: #000000;"> family</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>tree</strong> tracing back from grandson to grandpa. <strong>Try to trace your family tree</strong> from you up to your grandma or grandpa or great-grandparents. Click the family tree below to see an animation.</p>

<h2>Trace Back A <em>C. elegans </em>Intestine Cell</h2>
<p>This movie traces the development of intestine cells <strong>backwards</strong> to where they came from.</p>
<p><a href="embryogenesis-c-elegans">Embryogenesis of <em>C. elegans</em></a> has some background information to help you observe this movie. <em><a href="c-elegans-cell-lineage">C. elegans</a></em><a href="c-elegans-cell-lineage"> Cell Lineage</a> contains useful resources to help you understand the development of cell lineage.</p>

<h2>Questions to Get You Started<span style="color: #00cc00;"> </span></h2>
<ol>
   <li>What might be the similarities and differences between your family tree and a cell's family tree?</li>
   <li>Are the successor daughter cells in the <em>C. elegans</em> embryo developmentally more differentiated than their predecessors?</li>
   <li>Developmentally, are you more advanced/specified/differentiated than your grandparents?</li>
   <li>How do the fully differentiated intestinal cells differ from their mother cell?</li>
</ol>
