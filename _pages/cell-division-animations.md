Provided are two animations. The upper one illustrates common phenomena
observed from one cell dividing into two cells. The lower one
demonstrates early *C. elegans* embryo cell division. For more mitosis
animations, see [Cell Division and
Polarity](/cell-division-and-polarity "Cell Division and Polarity").

Mitosis: with common features and phenomena observed along this process.
This animation depicts one cell dividing into two daughter cells. From
the phenomenon observed below, you can try to characterize features and
properties that make a successful cell division possible. There are many
interesting phenomena like mictrotubules interacting with chromosomes
and the cell membrane ingresses to generate two daughter cells.

*C. elegans* early embryo division: with phenomena observed. This is a
Flash movie with various phenomena highlighted. You might want to
compare the features and phenomena you identified and the phenomena
highlighted here. You can also think about the biological indication for
these various phenmena during the completion of cell division.
