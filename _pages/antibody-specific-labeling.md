Antibodies (Ab)
---------------

Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that recognize
proteins from foreign organisms (infections, etc.) and tell the immune
system to attack the infection. To make antibodies to a specific
protein, the purified protein is injected into animals (often rabbits or
mice) and they produce antibodies that can be collected in the blood of
the injected animal. The serum is then purified to remove non-specific
antibodies that don't bind to the injected protein. These purified
antibodies can be used for a variety of techniques including
immunofluorescence.

Ab-specific Immunofluorescence Labeling
---------------------------------------

To observe one\'s favorite protein (e.g. a protein called tubulin, the
protein that makes up microtubules) in a *C. elegans* embryo, one can
inject tubulin into animals (such as rabbits or mice) to produce
anti-tubulin antibodies. With anti-tubulin antibodies, the amount and
localization of tubulin can be detected in *C. elegans* embryos. Below
is a flash movie showing the expression of two proteins (tubulin &
syntaxin-4) using antibody-specific immunofluorescence labeling.
