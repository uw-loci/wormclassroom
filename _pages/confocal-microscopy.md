Confocal microscopy is used for imaging fluorescent signals, usually in
fixed specimens. It generates high resolution optical sections.

This is a C. elegans embryo at the 2-cell stage (bigger AB cell at
bottom, P1 at the top). Red represents the membrane, green represents
the microtubules (MTs) and blue shows its chromosome. This image
combines images from 3 different channels. The membrane, MTs and
chromosome were imaged using 3 channels, color-mapped to 3 colors
([red]{style="color: #ff0000;"}, [green]{style="color: #009900;"}, and
[blue]{style="color: #000099;"}).
