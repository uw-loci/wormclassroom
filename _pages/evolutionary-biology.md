Evolutionary Biology Research Questions
---------------------------------------

Evolutionary biology is the study of the history of life. Evolutionary
biologists try to gain insights into the life histories of different
groups of organisms primarily through comparative studies of individual
species. What changes occurred to make all the different morphologies
and life strategies we observe in organisms today? [Read

Evolutionary Biology Research: Tools, Procedures & Methodologies
----------------------------------------------------------------

In *C. elegans* most workers are working on comparative developmental
biology. As a result they take advantage of all of the normal tools of
*C. elegans* developmental biology, such as forward genetic screens to
identify processes in an unbiased manner. [Read
