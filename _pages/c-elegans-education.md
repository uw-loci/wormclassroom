### An Ideal Model Organism in Teaching

*C. elegans* has grown its popularity in the classroom. At the 12th *C.
elegans* Meeting held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999,
several educators presented their uses of *C. elegans* as an educational
model. The reasons they use *C. elegans* in teaching are similar to why
biologists use *C. elegans* as a model system in research. [Read

### A Survey of C. elegans Curricula (1999)

At the 12th *C. elegans* Meeting, a teaching workshop was held for
educators who use *C. elegans* in their classrooms. During the meeting,
the teachers exchanged their experiences, including how to invoke
students' interest in science. A poster session was held after the
teaching workshop, where educators displayed and discussed how they have
incorporated *C. elegans* into their curricula. After the meeting, I met
with most of these *C. elegans* educators, discussed how they used *C.
elegans*, and obtained their permission to include descriptions of their
use in my project. -*Fong-Mei Lu*
