Below is the opportunity for you to lineage the embryo development of
*C. elegans* up to the 8-cell stage. You might want to visit [Human
Family Tree](/human-family-tree "Human Family Tree") to start thinking
about \"lineage.\" Also, [Embryogenesis of *C.
elegans*](embryogenesis-c-elegans "C. elegans Embryogenesis") can help
you make observations of the embryonic development.

 

Background Information {#background-information style="font-size: 1.5em;"}
----------------------

-   A [bit of
    history](/example-research-cell-lineage "Example Research - Cell Lineage") about
    the *C. elegans* cell lineage: When was the whole lineage finished?
    How was the lineage done?
-   The meaning of [cell lineage/fate
    map](about-cell-lineage-and-fate-mapping) in development
-   [Embryo development in 4D](embryo-development-4d): What is a 4D
    movie? How is a 4D movie generated? Brief tutorial and information
    regarding the use of VisBio to lineage the 4D embryo development
    movie.
-   WormBase has the information for cell pedigree of *C. elegans*.
    See [how to use
    WormBase](/using-wormbase-find-cell-pedigree "Using WormBase to find Cell Pedigree") to
    find the cell pedigree.

 

4D Movie Data Set
-----------------

![A cell at focal point 6](files/worm/CECellLineageFP6.jpg){width="285"
height="342"}

Most of the movies and images on this site - including the one above -
have been compressed to make them easier to download, although
compression destroys some of the data in the file. Educators may find
smaller files (such as JPG and MOV) easier to work with, while
researchers use *lossless* files (such as TIFF) to retain every pixel of
the collected data.

[EmbryoCE.zip](http://loci.wisc.edu/files/software/data/EmbryoCE.zip) (290
MB) is a 4D dataset of embryo development up to 8-cell stage. It
consists of 12 TIFF files, one for each focal plane. To unzip the
file, one can use [WinZip](http://www.winzip.com/) (for PC) or [Stuffit
Expander](https://support.apple.com/en_US/downloads) (for Mac). Once the
file is unzipped, it can be read using
[ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/ "Opens in new window") and the [Data
Browser](http://loci.wisc.edu/software/data-browser "Opens in new window")
plugin.

Note: ImageJ and EmbryoCE are real research tools - not instructional
materials. As such, their usage is more complex than most files on this
site. If you have questions, please [contact us](contact).

Questions to Get You Thinking
-----------------------------

1.  What does the lineage (family tree) look like for each focal plane?
2.  Does a cell always have the same neighbors and how important this
    might be in its development?
3.  Why is the cell lineage/cell pattern of lineage the way it is?
4.  Does a specific cell always appear at around the same time in every
    embryo?
5.  Which of the daughter cells divides first?
6.  Why are two daughter cells unequal size after cell division?
7.  Why do the edges of the cells wiggle so much?
8.  When is a cell\'s fate determined?
9.  How are different cell types generated?

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have lineaged the development of an embryo,
observe the [different types of cells
color-coded](files/worm/C.%20elegans%20Cell%20Lineage%20to%208-Cell.pdf) (PDF ![](files/worm/pdf.gif){width="15"
height="16"}).

Then [construct a 4D embryo](construct-4d-embryo): A lineaged embryo up
to the 100-cell stage gives you the opportunity to observe and construct
your own analysis of 4-dimensional embryonic development.
