Morgan (1999) noted that \"Many of the features that make *C. elegans*
an excellent research organism - its small size, rapid life cycle, and
ease of cultivation - also make it useful for undergraduate instruction,
including courses in genetics, developmental biology, and molecular
biology.\" While *C. elegans* is popularly used in research
laboratories, its use is increasing in education.

At the 12th *C. elegans* Meeting, a teaching workshop was held for
educators who use *C. elegans* in their classrooms. During the meeting,
the teachers exchanged their experiences, including how to provoke
students\' interest in science. A poster session was held after the
teaching workshop, where educators displayed and discussed how they have
incorporated *C. elegans* into their curricula. After the meeting, I met
with most of these *C. elegans* educators, discussed how they used *C.
elegans*, and obtained their permission to include descriptions of their
use in my project.
