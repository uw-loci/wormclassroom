How does a cell manage to divide into two cells? Why are development
arrested? The study of cell division in *C. elegans* helps us uncover
the relationship between genes and their expressions.

A wild type: this will develop into a worm.\

Research Questions
------------------

1.  How do genes regulate organisms\' development?
2.  Are genes found in one organism also found in other organisms? (ties
    to evolutionary biology)

[Genotype/Phenotype
module](/genotype-vs-phenotype-module "Genotype vs. Phenotype Module"):
instructional materials for learning the relationship between genotype
and phenotype by inquiry. Students get to observe phenomena, pose
questions, collect evidences etc. Animations, movies, images and
hands-on tools are provided to assist learning. With adequate citation,
materials are free to be used in other pedagogical approaches.
