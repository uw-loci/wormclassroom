WormClassroom is intended to serve as an education portal for the
research model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* (*C. elegans*; within
the field it is also known as the "worm"). Information about what *C.
elegans* is, what areas of scientific research use *C. elegans* and who
is working on *C. elegans* can be found. Instructional materials created
using *C. elegans* research resources are provided for teaching and
learning various biology disciplines.\
\
By making *C. elegans* research resources available for education, we
aim to establish a framework for the dissemination of scientific
research resources that science educators can follow and adapt. It is
our hope that this framework will be useful to educators trying to use
other model organisms (e.g.: fruitfly, zebrafish) in their curricula.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Â 

### 1) What is *C. elegans*?

*C. elegans* is a free living round worm that is about 1 mm in length.
It can be found in the soil in many regions and feeds on bacteria. Read
more [about *C. elegans*](meet-worm-caenorhabditis-elegans)....

### 2) Why study *C. elegans*?

Although it is tiny and considered primitive, *C. elegans* shares many
biological properties with other more advanced organisms, such as the
human. Read more about its [research potential](why-study-c-elegans)....

### 3) What is WormClassroom?

WormClassroom is meant to be a community resource for all interested in
teaching and learning with and about *C. elegans*. As worm is the common
nickname for *C. elegans,* we use "WormClassroom" to refer to our
mission which is to serve as an education portal to *C. elegans*
research and resources. For the purpose of the web site, the terms
"worm" and "*C. elegans*" will be used interchangeably.

### 4) What can be found at WormClassroom.org?

Information such as what a worm is, who is working on the worm, what
research has been done using the worm and the instructional materials
developed using the resulting research data can be found.

### 5) Who is the target audience?

The material provided is aimed for informal and formal science education
use. In particular, we have designed instructional materials for use in
advanced high school and introductory college biology courses. We are
seeking to make available instructional materials for K-12 as well. It
is our hope that this web site may also be of use to new *C. elegans*
researchers and the general public.

### 6) Why are *C. elegans* research resources being made available as educational materials?

As a widely studied model research organism, there are many important
research findings and resources available from the *C. elegans*
community. As these findings and resources have helped researchers
elucidate key biological principles, they are also useful in teaching
biological curriculum.

### 7) How can I contribute my *C. elegans* teaching and research materials to this site?

Your contributions are very welcome. To submit materials, please see the
[contributions page](contribute).

### 8) How do I cite materials from WormClassroom?

Resources at this site can be used freely for education purposes. If you
would like to cite your use of a resource, you may use this format:

> WormClassroom.org, \[date of publication, if available\], \[page
> title\], \[retrieved from URL\]
