Â 

-   Look at the biggest worm.
-   In the middle part on the left side of the picture, you can see an
    eyelash which can be used to pick a worm and also to let you
    understand the relative size of the worm.
-   This is not an adult worm yet. It is a larva.
-   You can also see the worm's head which is toward you.
-   Around the worm, you can see some smaller larvae.
