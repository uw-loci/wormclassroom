One of the most prevalent types of microscopy is the optical sectioning
microscope (including phase, nomarski and confocal microscope), where
the researcher can make 4-dimensional recordings (3D + time) of their
biological samples. The UW-Madison's [Laboratory for Optical and
Computational Instrumentation](http://loci.wisc.edu) (LOCI) has
developed a suite of tools to collect, annotate and analyze 4D data from
optical sectioning microscopes.

1.  A div camera was mounted on a microscope.
2.  Then the div signal was sent to an in-line image processor for image
    enhancement.
3.  After that, the images were stored in a computer.

Example Movie
-------------

The movie below was created using 4D software developed at
LOCI. [Differential Interference
Contrast](/differential-interference-contrast-dic-microscopy "Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy") microscopy
was used in order to observe living cells (many microscopy techniques
can only be used on dead cells). This movie shows the 2nd focal plane
with the embryo developing up to 100-cell embryonic stage.
