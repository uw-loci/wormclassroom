GFP is a protein found in *Aequorea victoria*, a bioluminescent
jellyfish. In order to visualize a particular protein you can attach GPF
to your protein so that it will fluoresce. This is done by taking the
DNA that encodes GFP and cloning it next to the gene that encodes your
gene. This DNA is then added into your organism so that the organism
makes the new fusion protein in the same way that it normally makes
proteins.
