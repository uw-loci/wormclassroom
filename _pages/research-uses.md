### Fundamental Questions Pursued

As described in [About *C. elegans*](about-c-elegans), *C. elegans* is a
model organism that is used to research various fundamental biology
questions. For example, how a cell knows when to do what and what makes
a successful cell division are intriguing and important questions to
understand.\
\
One thing to keep in mind is that current biological research is often
multidisciplinary in nature. The solving of one research question often
sheds light in different fields of study. For instance, the study of
cell division generates insights not only for cell biology but also
developmental biology. Below, some of the fundamental questions
currently being pursued are categorized into 5 areas of research. Also,
due to the multidisciplinary nature of scientific inquiry, research
questions may be cross listed among the fields.

-   [Cell Biology](cell-biology)
-   [Developmental Biology](developmental-biology)
-   [Genetics](genetics)
-   [Evolutionary Biology](evolutionary-biology)
-   [Neuroscience](neuroscience)
-   [Multidisciplinary](multidisciplinary-questions)

### Tools, Procedures, Methodologies

How are questions in *C. elegans* research solved? To gain biological
insights using the worm various tools, procedures and methodologies
first need to be established and then standardized. Methods as simple as
how to keep a worm happy in the lab to complicated techniques, such as
generating green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs, are vital
to worm research.\
\
Commonly used tools, procedures and methodologies in the worm research
community include:

-   [*C. elegans* cultivation](c-elegans-cultivation)
-   Behavioral analysis *([contribution needed](contribute))*
-   [Genetic techniques](/genetics "Genetics")
-   [Cell biology & microscopy](cell-biology-microscopy)
-   [Research protocols](/category/web-links/research-protocols)
