Why study *C. elegans* over other, more advanced organisms? The two main
reasons are commonalities with other organisms, and ease of operation.

**Commonalities**
-----------------

Organisms often share similar genes and biological principles. These
commonalities enable researchers to extrapolate their findings from one
organism to others.

For example, in human leukemia, large numbers of immature white blood
cells (WBCs), which normally die before getting into the blood stream,
are found in patients' blood circulation. The study of Programmed Cell
Death (PCD, or apoptosis) in *C. elegans* might help us to understand
why these immature WBCs didn't undergo PCD.

Although it is primitive and small, *C. elegans* shares many fundamental
cellular/molecular structures and biological characteristics with more
advanced organisms.

-   It is eukaryotic just like us. (more about [prokaryotes vs.
    eukaryotes](http://www.wiley.com/legacy/college/boyer/0470003790/animations/cell_structure/cell_structure.htm))
-   It has DNA as genetic materials. It produces RNA and protein as
    well.
-   It is a multicellular organism.
-   It develops from an embryo (sperm + egg) to adult using
    developmental processes (e.g.: differentiation & proliferation) that
    are also observed in other higher organisms.
-   It grows, reproduces, gets old and dies.
-   It has a digestive system for eating, a nerve system with a "brain"
    for "learning" and muscles to help it move.
-   Its genome size is small (\~ 10 Megabase) with about 40% homology to
    human (3.2 Gigabase).

**Ease of Operation**
---------------------

With limited time and lab space, organisms that are easy to grow and
store make ideal subjects.

-   Its size is small. The adult worm is only 1 mm. This makes it
    possible to house large numbers in a laboratory setting. The total
    number of somatic cells in an adult worm is about 959 cells
    comparing to human's trillions of cells.
-   Its [life
    cycle/span](/image/c-elegans-life-cycle "C. elegans Life Cycle")Â is
    short (about 3 days/weeks respectively). This shortens the amount of
    time needed for each experiment and increases the speed of
    scientific progress. Imagine an experimental organism with a life
    cycle of weeks or months (e.g. mice, primates); it would take years
    to gain insight into each research question.
-   It is transparent. This characteristic makes it an excellent tool
    for studying biology questions like cell division and cell lineage
    (a cell's family tree).
-   It is non-parasitic free-living that feeds on bacteria (e.g. *E.
    coli*). This makes it safe for use in laboratory settings.
