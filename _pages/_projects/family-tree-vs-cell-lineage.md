Think about the development of a human family tree, cells inside *C.
elegans* and even cells inside your body. What are the similarities and
differences between them?

Please observe the two movies below and come up with your observations
and questions for discussion.

Trace Back A Family Tree
------------------------

Here is an **example [[
family]{style="color: #000000;"}]{style="color: #660000;"}[
]{style="color: #000000;"}tree** tracing back from grandson to grandpa.
**Try to trace your family tree** from you up to your grandma or grandpa
or great-grandparents. Click the family tree below to see an animation.

Trace Back A *C. elegans* Intestine Cell
----------------------------------------

This movie traces the development of intestine cells **backwards** to
where they came from.

[Embryogenesis of *C. elegans*](embryogenesis-c-elegans) has some
background information to help you observe this movie. *[C.
elegans](c-elegans-cell-lineage)*[Cell Lineage](c-elegans-cell-lineage)
contains useful resources to help you understand the development of cell
lineage.

Questions to Get You Started[ ]{style="color: #00cc00;"}
--------------------------------------------------------

1.  What might be the similarities and differences between your family
    tree and a cell's family tree?
2.  Are the successor daughter cells in the *C. elegans* embryo
    developmentally more differentiated than their predecessors?
3.  Developmentally, are you more advanced/specified/differentiated than
    your grandparents?
4.  How do the fully differentiated intestinal cells differ from their
    mother cell?
