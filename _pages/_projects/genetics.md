Genetics Research Questions
---------------------------

Geneticists are interested in how genes affect the formation/development
of cells/organisms. For instance, PAR (partitioning defect) genes are
important in *C. elegans* cell polarization. The deletion of PAR2, one
of the PAR family genes, in a *C. elegans* zygote will produce two
identical daughter cells instead of two unequal sizes daughter cells
([AB and P1 cells](example-research-cell-lineage)).

Here is a list of *C. elegans* [genetics research
questions](genetics-questions) to get you start thinking about research
in genetics.

Genetics Research: Tools, Procedures & Methodologies
----------------------------------------------------

-   [Crosses](/genetic-techniques-crosses "Genetic Techniques - Crosses"):
    cross between hermaphrodite & male *([contribution
    needed](contribute))*
-   [Mutagenesis](/genetic-techniques-mutagenesis "Genetic Techniques - Mutagenesis"):
    use mutagens to generate mutants *([contribution
    needed](contribute))*
-   [Screen](/genetic-techniques-screen "Genetic Techniques - Screen"):
    search for desired phenotype *([contribution needed](contribute))*
-   [Gene
    mapping](/genetic-techniques-gene-mapping "Genetic Techniques - Gene Mapping") *([contribution
    needed](contribute))*
-   [RNAi](/genetic-techniques-rnai "Genetic Techniques - RNAi") *([contribution
    needed](contribute))*
-   [*C. elegans* cultivation](c-elegans-cultivation)

Techniques from [cell biology](cell-biology) may be used in conjuction
with genetic techniques to analyze and understand the consequences of
genetic manipulation such as mutagenesis, screen or crosses.
