*C. elegans* is a free-living, non-parasitic soil nematode that can be
found throughout the world. It is transparent and about [1mm in
size](https://www.cellsalive.com/howbig.htm). \"Worm\" is its nickname.
Researchers working with *C. elegans* call themselves \"worm people\"
and form the \"worm community\" of research.

### A Quick Peek at a Plate of C. elegans

-   Look at the biggest worm, it is an adult worm.
-   The one next to the biggest worm is a larva.
-   There is a scale in the right lower corner to let you understand the
    relative size of the worm.
-   You can also see this adult worm\'s head which is toward upper right
    corner.
-   You may notice, *C. elegans* can move both forward and backward.
-   There is an embryo to the upper left corner.
-   There is also a [larger version](files/worm/AdultYoung.mov) of this
    movie.

### Feed

*C. elegans* feeds on bacteria (such as E. coli) or anything else that
fits in its mouth. Video of a [worm
eating](http://www.mcb.arizona.edu/wardlab/eatingvid.html).

### Sexes

There are two sexes, hermaphrodite and male. \[fn\]Hermaphrodite and

### \[img\_assist\|nid=18\|title=\|desc=\|link=none\|align=right\|width=212\|height=160\]Sex Determination

*C. elegans* has five pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosome.
Sexual determination in *C. elegans* is similar to *Drosophila*; the
ratio of sex chromosomes to autosomes determines its sex. If the 6th
chromosome pair is XX, then *C. elegans* will be a hermaphrodite. A XO
combination in the 6th chromosome pair will produce a male. XO
combination in male is the spontaneous loss of X chromosome (XX -\> XO).
When a male crosses with a hermaphrodite, the progeny will be half males
and half hermaphrodites.

### Fertilization

Hermaphrodites can self-fertilize or cross with males. However,
hermaphrodites cannot fertilize another hermaphrodite. Males can only
cross with hermaphrodites. Crossing between a male and hermaphrodite
produces more progeny than the self-fertilization of a hermaphrodite
(about 350 progeny). \[fn\]*C. elegans* nothanks drawing: Hernan

### Life Cycle & Life Span

Its life cycle and life span are about 3 days and 3 weeks, respectively.
