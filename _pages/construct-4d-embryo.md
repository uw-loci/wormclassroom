This is the same embryo as the one you just
[observed](/files/worm/C.%20elegans%20Cell%20Lineage%20to%208-Cell.pdf)
(PDF ![PDF](/files/worm/pdf.gif){width="15" height="16"}) and
[lineaged](c-elegans-cell-lineage). The lineaging has been completed up
to 100-cell embryonic stage. You may find it interesting to constuct a
4D map for the embryonic development using the movies provided below.

individual focal planes; right-click to save.

Coding System
-------------

Dr. Sulston's naming system was followed in lineaging this embryo.
However, as the embryo divides, the dividing cells becoming smaller and
the cells' name becoming longer. Thus, it is difficult to put the whole
name on the recorded embryo (especially for AB and MS series cells).
Therefore, a number is used instead of a letter to indicate the location
for AB and MS series cells. Download the [coding
system](/files/worm/CodingSystem.pdf) (PDF
![PDF](/files/worm/pdf.gif){width="15" height="16"}) to see how this was
done.

**[Note:]{style="color: #cc0000;"}** Only **D** series cells were
recorded in **black**. Due to the recording imperfection, some of the
[AB]{style="color: #ff0000;"} cells were recorded in **black** with
partial digit showed (like [**57**]{style="color: #ff0000;"} in the
upper right corner was recorded as **5** at Time Elapsed 02:28:40 in
focal plane 3). Please only use the name recorded in
[red]{style="color: #ff0000;"} for [AB]{style="color: #ff0000;"} series
in the embryonic development.

Family Tree for Focal Planes 1-9
--------------------------------

![An example family
tree](/files/worm/CellLineageFocal1_9.jpg){width="357" height="230"}

This family tree was constructed right after the 8th cell appears
(between 50:00 and 51:00 depending on the focal plane).

Family Tree for Focal Plane 10
------------------------------

![Focal Plane 10](/files/worm/CellLineageFocal10.jpg){width="402"
height="230"}

This was constructed right after the 8th cell appears (time point
00:50:58).

Family Tree for Focal Planes 11 & 12
------------------------------------

![](/files/worm/CellLineageFocal11_12.jpg){width="402" height="230"}

This was constructed right after the 8th cell appears (time point
00:50:59).

**Thought:** What does the 4D map look like? At any time point, are
cells in focal plane 1 also in focal plane 12 or other focal planes?
Pick a cell (e.g.: AB) and pretend that you are that cell. How big are
you, where are you and what will you become?
