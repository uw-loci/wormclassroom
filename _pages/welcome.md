WormClassroom is intended to serve as an education portal for the
research model organism *Caenorhabditis elegans* (*C. elegans*); within
the field it is also known as the \"worm\". Information about what *C.
elegans* is, what areas of scientific research use *C. elegans* and who
is working on *C. elegans* can be found. Instructional materials created
using *C. elegans* research resources are provided for teaching and
learning various biology disciplines.\
\
By making *C. elegans* research resources available for education, we
aim to establish a framework for the dissemination of scientific
research resources that science educators can follow and adapt. It is
our hope that this framework will be useful to educators trying to use
other model organisms (e.g.: fruitfly, zebrafish) in their curricula.
