| Imagine this as an egg. Because   | This is a 3D image. This set of   |
| it is 3 dimensional, it is        | images is from one \"time         |
| difficult to penetrate and see    | point\". Thus, it is 3D instead   |
| its inside. Each white line       | of 4D. This *C. elegans* embryo   |
| represents a section (called a    | image was generated using a       |
| focal plane) through this egg.    | computer program                  |
