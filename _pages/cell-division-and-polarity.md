Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cell Division
--------------------------------------

The movie of asymmetric cell division shows an embryo development up to
2-cell stage to match the division stage in symmetric cell division. The
same animation with [development up to 4-cell
stage](/files/worm/PolarityAll.mov) is available (7.8 MB, movie length:
1\'56\").

About these two cell divisions:

1.  **Left - Symmetric cell division:** This illustrates the
    proliferation of cells from one to two. It generates two same-size
    daughter cells that possess the same components and will develop
    into same cell type.
2.  **Right - Asymmetric cell division** (also known as determinative
    cell division): it yields two daughter cells with different
    developmental potentials. These two daughter cells might be
    different in size and shape and will develop into two different
    types of cells, e.g.: muscle and nerve cells.
