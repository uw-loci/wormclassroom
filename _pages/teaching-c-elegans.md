*C. elegans* has grown its popularity in the classroom. At the 12th *C.
elegans* Meeting held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999,
several educators presented their uses of *C. elegans* as an educational
model. The reasons they use *C. elegans* in teaching are similar to why
biologists use *C. elegans* as a model system in research.

This small worm is paving its way in educational use due to its short
life cycle, its small size, its transparent body, its ease of
cultivation, its ability to be crossed at will and the similarity of its
genome to that of the human. In addition to these advantages, the
available resources, such as the stock of mutants, the completion of its
genome sequence, and various advanced tools, make it easy to use *C.
elegans* in classrooms.

Being able to house *C. elegans* and culture it in the classroom is the
first step to use it in teaching. It is also a good model organism for
students to watch animal behavior, because *C. elegans* shows a
diversity of behaviors. It can taste, smell, and sense light and
temperature. These characteristics make *C. elegans* a good experimental
organism for students to study behavior (Aamodt, 1999; DeStasio, 1999).

Large numbers of mutant stocks make it an attractive teaching material
as well. It is easy to get a mutated worm with a desired trait. For
example, motional defective worms can be used to teach muscle physiology
or for students to understand how mutations influence a worm's
phenotype. Various mutagens can be used to produce mutants. For
instance, ethylmathanesulforate (EMS) is a mutagen that induces direct
mutations in DNA, such as missense and nonsense mutations. In teaching
genetics, the selection of mutants is essential and EMS can be used to
treat *C. elegans* to produce desired mutants (Miller, 1999; Morgan,
1999b; Sulcove & Allen, 1999).

can be used to show when and where a protein is expressed that implies
the expression of a gene. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter
gene is a gene cloned from jellyfish. It can be fused to a piece of DNA
and expressed with that gene. By observing the worm with the green
fluorescent protein under a microscope, the expression of a gene can be
seen, and its timing, location and quantity of the gene expression can
be monitored (Aroian, Johnson, & Wienhausen, 1999; Miller, 1999; Morgan,
1999b). In addition, the invention of advanced microscopes and the
completion of the complete *C. elegans* cell lineage are good for
teaching development. Generally speaking, the motility of *C. elegans*
can be observed by using dissecting microscopes. However, by using
advanced microscopes, such as Nomarski optics, students can observe the
process of development and morphogenesis in a single cell (Miller,
1999).

Available molecular techniques are useful to help students learn more
advanced topics. For instance, the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) can
be used to detect the existence of a specific gene in *C. elegans*.
Chemical reagents, such as colchicine, an alkaloid toxic, which
interrupts cell division at mitosis, can be used to study cell division
and development (Lissemore, Lackner, & Fedoriw, 1999; Miller, 1999).

As more resources become available for a model experimental system, its
success as an educational model increases. As Robert Waterston said, the
completion of *C. elegans* genome is a start rather than an end in the
biological research, thus, it is predictable that there will be more
discoveries based on the use of *C. elegans* that will make it a more
attractive model organism in the curriculum.
