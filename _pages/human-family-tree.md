Questions to Get You Thinking
-----------------------------

1.  What is a human family tree?
2.  What does your family tree look like?
3.  What can you discover from your family tree?
4.  How is your family tree different or similar to other people\'s
    family trees?

**Draw your own family tree:** You may find it interesting to draw your
own family tree. You can try to start from your grandparents.

**Cell pedigree**: think about the development of *C. elegans* from
[one-cell embryo to an adult
worm](/embryogenesis-c-elegans "Embryogenesis of C. elegans") and the
\"growth\" of your family tree. Is there any analogy between the worm
development and family tree growth?
