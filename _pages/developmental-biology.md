Developmental Biology Research Questions
----------------------------------------

Developmental biologists are interested in questions such as how a
zygote develops into an organism and how a cell manages to successfully
divide into two daughter cells. They try to understand how a
cell/organism develops from time A to time B, what makes the development
successful and how it is established and maintained.\
\
Here is a list of *C. elegans* [developmental biology research
questions](developmental-biology-questions) to help you start thinking
about research in developmental biology.
