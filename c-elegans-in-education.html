<!-- C. elegans in Education -->

<h3>An Ideal Model Organism in Teaching</h3>
<p><em>C. elegans</em> has grown its popularity in the classroom. At the 12th <em>C. elegans</em> Meeting held at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1999, several educators presented their uses of <em>C. elegans </em>as an educational model. The reasons they use <em>C. elegans</em> in teaching are similar to why biologists use <em>C. elegans</em> as a model system in research. <a href="teaching-c-elegans">Read more....</a></p>
<h3>A Survey of C. elegans Curricula (1999)</h3>
<p>At the 12th <em>C. elegans</em> Meeting, a teaching workshop was held for educators who use <em>C. elegans</em> in their classrooms. During the meeting, the teachers exchanged their experiences, including how to invoke students' interest in science. A poster session was held after the teaching workshop, where educators displayed and discussed how they have incorporated <em>C. elegans</em> into their curricula. After the meeting, I met with most of these <em>C. elegans</em> educators, discussed how they used <em>C. elegans</em>, and obtained their permission to include descriptions of their use in my project. -<em>Fong-Mei Lu</em></p>
