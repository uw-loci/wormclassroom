It is very labor intensive to lineage an embryo\'s development. If you
skip one day, you lose track of some cell divisions (Sulston, 1983).
Now, with the help of advanced technologies and software development,
researchers are able to record the development of an embryo as a
4-dimensional (3 dimensions in space + time = 4 dimensions) movie. They
then are able to observe and annotate the movie using programs such as
[VisBio](http://loci.wisc.edu/software/visbio).

Example 4D Movie
----------------

This is a 4D movie that was composed by 3 focal planes - focal plane 2,
4 and 6 (for demonstration purpose we only picked 3 focal planes to
use). Hit play, then try to go up, down, forward and backward to see how
the movie changed with the changing depth and time. For instance, you
might see nuclei in focal plane 6 but not in focal plane 2 and 4.
