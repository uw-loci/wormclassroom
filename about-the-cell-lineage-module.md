\"Learning Modules\" are being developed on WormClassroom to serve as an
interactive and self-contained learning environment complete with its
own learning objectives. The *C. elegans* Cell Lineage learning module
is one of the first released modules.

The *C. elegans* Cell Lineage Learning Module gives student the
opportunity to track a cell\'s development and trace its predecessors
and successors. Students can investigate the spatial relationship
(left/right, anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral) of cells during
embryonic development. The learning objectives for this module include:

1.  Understanding fundamental biology concepts such as cells'
    predecessors and successors, the spatial relationship among
    developing cells, the invariant cell lineage in embryonic
    development,
2.  Developing the ability to inquire, and
3.  Gaining insights toward the completion of cell lineage. The intent
    is that with exploration of this module students will understand
    cell lineaging and how the completion of the *C. elegans* cell
    lineage has broad implications to other key biological concepts such
    as cellular differentiation.

Example Mini-Modules

Modules developed using materials in this Cell Lineage Module.

4D Development
--------------

The primarily learning objective is to help students understand
development happens in space (3-dimensional) and time (3D + time =
4-dimensional).

### Learning Objectives

Major concept: Development happens in space (3-Dimension) plus time
(4-D). This include 3-D and 4-D in development 

Sub-concepts: 

-   Cells/embryos have depth -- 3 dimensions
-   Axes of body plan : A/P, dorsal/ ventral, (left and right: not as
    crucial, can be reversed)) 
-   In early embryogenesis, the mass of an embryo does not change (while
    cell number increases) during an embryo's development 
-   Embryo vs. stem cell (a multi-potential cell)

Time required: Approximately six hours class time.
