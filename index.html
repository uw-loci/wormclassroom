<!-- Welcome

<p>WormClassroom is intended to serve as an education portal for the research model organism <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (<em>C. elegans</em>); within the field it is also known as the "worm". Information about what <em>C. elegans</em> is, what areas of scientific research use <em>C. elegans</em> and who is working on <em>C. elegans</em> can be found. Instructional materials created using <em>C. elegans </em>research resources are provided for teaching and learning various biology disciplines.<br><br>By making <em>C. elegans</em> research resources available for education, we aim to establish a framework for the dissemination of scientific research resources that science educators can follow and adapt. It is our hope that this framework will be useful to educators trying to use other model organisms (e.g.: fruitfly, zebrafish) in their curricula.</p>
