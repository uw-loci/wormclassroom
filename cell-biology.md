Cell Biology Research Questions
-------------------------------

Cell biologists study phenomena inside a cell. They ask questions such
as: how do different cellular components interact with each other during
cell division, how do microtubules (MTs) form, what molecules are MTs
composed of and how do MTs catch and move chromosomes to the right place
at the right time.\
\
Here is a list of *C. elegans* [cell biology research
questions](cell-biology-questions) to get you to start thinking about
research in cell biology.
