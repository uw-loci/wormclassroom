Being transparent and amenable to laboratory manipulation, *C. elegans*
cell lineage was first completed by John Sulston in the 1980s. Cell
lineage is similar to the family tree of cells. The development of a
cell\'s predecessor and successors can be determined from the lineage.

Drawing by Hand
---------------

The [transparency](c-elegans-transparency) of *C. elegans* made the
lineaging possible. Dr. John Sulston spent one and a half years (in the
dark) to complete the *C. elegans* cell lineage. Dr. Sulston
[hand-drew](/image/c-elegans-lineage-hand-drawing-john-sulston "C. elegans lineage hand drawing by John Sulston")
the real-time worm development. Originally, the *C. elegans* embryo
development wasn\'t recorded in video for lineaging.

> \"The cell lineage is the description of the history of each embryonic
> cell, beginning with the un-cleaved egg. The products of every
> division are traced until the rudiments of the embryonic organs become
> distinct.\" (**Ways of Knowing**, John Moore, p. 494)

As the [complete cell lineage](/files/worm/embryonic.jpg) (JPG, 1 MB)
shows, from top to bottom, you can see an un-cleaved, just fertilized
zygote, P0 cell divides into two daughter cells (AB and P1 cells)
![](/files/worm/ABP1.jpg){width="86" height="54"}. The two daughter
cells then divide into more daughter
cellsÂ ![](/files/worm/ABP1Next.jpg){width="86" height="70"} that
eventually form a map and enable one to trace a cell\'s predecessors and
successors.

Microscopy Techniques
---------------------

Later, Nomarski optics (also known as [Differential Interference
Contrast](differential-interference-contrast-dic-microscopy) (DIC)
microscopy) was also used:

(a one-cell embryo with paternal and maternal pro-nuclei meeting in the
center)

This video shows the embryonic development from 1-cell to 100-cell:

Research Questions {#research-questions .title}
------------------

1.  What is derived from each cell?
2.  Do cells from the same mother cell behave the same?
3.  Do cells migrate after they are born?
4.  Do all *C. elegans* embryos develop in the same pattern? Is this
    true for all organisms?
5.  Do neighbor cells affect the development of a cell?

------------------------------------

The [*C. elegans* Cell Lineage
Module](/cell-lineage-module "Cell Lineage Module"): instructional
materials for teaching cell lineage by inquiry. Resources can be
used/adapted for teaching disciplines (e.g.: developmental biology, cell
biology, genetics) with other instructional approaches (e.g.: lectures,
lab) as well. Animations, movies, images and hands-on tools are
included.
