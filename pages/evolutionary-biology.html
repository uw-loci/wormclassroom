<h2>Evolutionary Biology Research Questions</h2>
<p>Evolutionary biology is the study of the history of life. Evolutionary biologists try to gain insights into the life histories of different groups of organisms primarily through comparative studies of individual species. What changes occurred to make all the different morphologies and life strategies we observe in organisms today? <a href="evolutionary-biology-questions">Read more....</a></p>
<h2>Evolutionary Biology Research: Tools, Procedures &amp; Methodologies</h2>
<p>In <em>C. elegans</em> most workers are working on comparative developmental biology. As a result they take advantage of all of the normal tools of <em>C. elegans</em> developmental biology, such as forward genetic screens to identify processes in an unbiased manner. <a href="evolutionary-biology-research-tools">Read more....</a></p>
