<!-- Making the Movies -->

<p>One of the most prevalent types of microscopy is the optical sectioning microscope (including phase, nomarski and confocal microscope), where the researcher can make 4-dimensional recordings (3D + time) of their biological samples. The UW-Madison's <a href="http://loci.wisc.edu" target="_blank">Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation</a> (LOCI) has developed a suite of tools to collect, annotate and analyze 4D data from optical sectioning microscopes.</p>

   <li>A div camera was mounted on a microscope.</li>
   <li>Then the div signal was sent to an in-line image processor for image enhancement.</li>
   <li>After that, the images were stored in a computer.</li>

<h2>Example Movie</h2>
<p>The movie below was created using 4D software developed at LOCI.&nbsp;<a title="Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscopy" href="/differential-interference-contrast-dic-microscopy">Differential Interference Contrast</a>&nbsp;microscopy was used in order to observe living cells (many microscopy techniques can only be used on dead cells). This movie shows the 2nd focal plane with the embryo developing up to 100-cell embryonic stage.</p>
