<h2>Difference Between Focal Planes</h2>

<p><strong>Movie Recorded from Two Focal Planes with Time Series:</strong> Movie on the left displays focal plane 2 while the movie in the right is from focal plane 6. As you can see, at a specific time point, you will find each focal plane records a dimension of the embryo's development. Combining all the focal planes, we are able to observe the whole embryo (3D) developing with time (4D).</p>

<p>As you observe a 4D movie, you might encounter a focus shifting like the one you see from time point "00:21:50" to "00:22:05". How could this happen? At this early stage, the microscope operator somtimes wants to get a clearer view of the image. Thus, the focus was adjusted to obtain a better image.</p>
