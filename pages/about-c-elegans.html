<!-- About C. elegans

<h3><em>C. elegans</em>: the worm</h3>
<p><em>C. elegans</em> is a free-living, non-parasitic soil nematode that can be found throughout the world. It is transparent and about 1mm in size. "Worm" is its nickname. Researchers working with <em>C. elegans</em> call themselves "worm people" and form the "worm community" of research.</p>

<h3>Why Study <em>C. elegans</em>?</h3>
<p>Why study <em>C. elegans</em> over other more advanced organisms? The two main reasons are commonalities with other organisms, and ease of operation.</p>

<h3><em>C. elegans</em> as a Model Organism</h3>
<p>Organisms like <em>C. elegans</em> are known as model organisms because they can be used to closely study and elucidate our understanding of basic biological phenomena that might not be easily researched in other organisms. <em>C. elegans</em> was first selected by Sydney Brenner for study for its properties as a model organism.</p>

<h3>Other Common Model Organisms</h3>
<p>As you might guess, there are various model organisms used to study different biological phenomena. For instance, prokaryotic model organisms (e.g. <em>E. coli</em>) are useful for understanding other prokaryotic organisms (e.g. bacteria) that are often valuable in human disease research.</p>

<h3>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2002</h3>
<p>Acknowledging the completion of <em>C. elegans</em> cell lineage and accompanying research in cell death, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2002 was awarded to three <em>C. elegans</em> researchers that contributed to the "understanding of genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death" [fn]<a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/press.html">Press Release</a>, The 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine[/fn].</p>
