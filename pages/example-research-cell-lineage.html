<!-- Example Research - Cell Lineage -->

<p>Being transparent and amenable to laboratory manipulation, <em>C. elegans</em> cell lineage was first completed by John Sulston in the 1980s. Cell lineage is similar to the family tree of cells. The development of a cell's predecessor and successors can be determined from the lineage.</p>
<h2>Creating the Cell Lineage of <em>C. elegans</em></h2>
<p>A bit of history:</p>
<blockquote>
   <p>"...[B]ut it sufficed to get us started in earnest on the cell lineage. The significance was that although Sydney had wanted from the beginning of the project to follow cell lineages, it was presumed that the most interesting development happened in the egg. So this was the only stage that had been studied, but it was proving very difficult to see anything. It meant, however, that there were already Nomarski DIC (differential interference contrast) microscopes in the lab.</p>
   <p>Seeing my first cell division was an exciting moment, because it implied that determining the larval lineage was possible."</p>

<h2>Drawing by Hand</h2>
<p>The <a href="c-elegans-transparency">transparency</a> of <em>C. elegans</em> made the lineaging possible. Dr. John Sulston spent one and a half years (in the dark) to complete the <em>C. elegans</em> cell lineage. Dr. Sulston <a title="C. elegans lineage hand drawing by John Sulston" href="/image/c-elegans-lineage-hand-drawing-john-sulston">hand-drew</a> the real-time worm development. Originally, the <em>C. elegans</em> embryo development wasn't recorded in div for lineaging.</p>
<blockquote>
   <p>"The cell lineage is the description of the history of each embryonic cell, beginning with the un-cleaved egg. The products of every division are traced until the rudiments of the embryonic organs become distinct." (<strong>Ways of Knowing</strong>, John Moore, p. 494)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the <a href="/files/worm/embryonic.jpg">complete cell lineage</a> (JPG, 1 MB) shows, from top to bottom, you can see an un-cleaved, just fertilized zygote, P0 cell divides into two daughter cells (AB and P1 cells) <img src="/files/worm/ABP1.jpg" width="86" height="54" border="0">. The two daughter cells then divide into more daughter cells&nbsp;<img src="/files/worm/ABP1Next.jpg" width="86" height="70" border="0"> that eventually form a map and enable one to trace a cell's predecessors and successors.</p>
<h2>Microscopy Techniques</h2>
<p>Later, Nomarski optics (also known as <a href="differential-interference-contrast-dic-microscopy">Differential Interference Contrast</a> (DIC) microscopy) was also used:</p>

<h2 class="title">Research Questions</h2>
<ol>
   <li>What is derived from each cell?</li>
   <li>Do cells from the same mother cell behave the same?</li>
   <li>Do cells migrate after they are born?</li>
   <li>Do all <em>C. elegans</em> embryos develop in the same pattern? Is this true for all organisms?</li>
   <li>Do neighbor cells affect the development of a cell?</li>
</ol>

<p>The <a title="Cell Lineage Module" href="/cell-lineage-module"><em>C. elegans</em> Cell Lineage Module</a>: instructional materials for teaching cell lineage by inquiry. Resources can be used/adapted for teaching disciplines (e.g.: developmental biology, cell biology, genetics) with other instructional approaches (e.g.: lectures, lab) as well. Animations, movies, images and hands-on tools are included.</p>
