<!-- C. elegans Cell Lineage -->

<p>Below is the opportunity for you to lineage the embryo development of <em>C. elegans</em> up to the 8-cell stage. You might want to visit <a title="Human Family Tree" href="/human-family-tree">Human Family Tree</a> to start thinking about "lineage." Also, <a title="C. elegans Embryogenesis" href="embryogenesis-c-elegans">Embryogenesis of <em>C. elegans</em></a> can help you make observations of the embryonic development.</p>

<h2>4D Movie Data Set</h2>

<p>Most of the movies and images on this site - including the one above - have been compressed to make them easier to download, although compression destroys some of the data in the file. Educators may find smaller files (such as JPG and MOV) easier to work with, while researchers use <em>lossless </em>files (such as TIFF) to retain every pixel of the collected data.</p>
<p><a href="http://loci.wisc.edu/files/software/data/EmbryoCE.zip">EmbryoCE.zip</a>&nbsp;(290 MB) is a 4D dataset of embryo development up to 8-cell stage. It consists of 12 TIFF files, one for each focal plane. To unzip the file,&nbsp;one can use <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank">WinZip</a> (for PC) or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en_US/downloads" target="_blank">Stuffit Expander</a> (for Mac). Once the file is unzipped, it can be read using <a title="Opens in new window" href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" target="_blank">ImageJ</a> and the <a title="Opens in new window" href="http://loci.wisc.edu/software/data-browser" target="_blank">Data Browser</a> plugin.</p>
<p>Note: ImageJ and EmbryoCE are real research tools - not instructional materials. As such, their usage is more complex than most files on this site. If you have questions, please <a href="contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<h2>Questions to Get You Thinking</h2>
<ol>
   <li>What does the lineage (family tree) look like for each focal plane?</li>
   <li>Does a cell always have the same neighbors and how important this might be in its development?</li>
   <li>Why is the cell lineage/cell pattern of lineage the way it is?</li>
   <li>Does a specific cell always appear at around the same time in every embryo?</li>
   <li>Which of the daughter cells divides first?</li>
   <li>Why are two daughter cells unequal size after cell division?</li>
   <li>Why do the edges of the cells wiggle so much?</li>
   <li>When is a cell's fate determined?</li>
   <li>How are different cell types generated?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Now that you have lineaged the development of an embryo, observe&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="files/worm/C.%20elegans%20Cell%20Lineage%20to%208-Cell.pdf">different types of cells color-coded</a>&nbsp;(PDF&nbsp;<img src="files/worm/pdf.gif" style="border-width: 0px;" height="16" width="15" border="0">).</p>
<p>Then <a href="construct-4d-embryo">construct a 4D embryo</a>:&nbsp;A lineaged embryo up to the 100-cell stage gives you the opportunity to observe and construct your own analysis of 4-dimensional embryonic development.</p>
