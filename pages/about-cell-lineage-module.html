<!-- About the Cell Lineage Module -->

<p>"Learning Modules" are being developed on WormClassroom to serve as an interactive and self-contained learning environment complete with its own learning divives. The <em>C. elegans</em> Cell Lineage learning module is one of the first released modules.</p>
<p>The <em>C. elegans</em> Cell Lineage Learning Module gives student the opportunity to track a cell's development and trace its predecessors and successors. Students can investigate the spatial relationship (left/right, anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral) of cells during embryonic development. The learning divives for this module include:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Understanding fundamental biology concepts such as cells’ predecessors and successors, the spatial relationship among developing cells, the invariant cell lineage in embryonic development,</li>
   <li>Developing the ability to inquire, and</li>
   <li>Gaining insights toward the completion of cell lineage. The intent is that with exploration of this module students will understand cell lineaging and how the completion of the <em>C. elegans</em> cell lineage has broad implications to other key biological concepts such as cellular differentiation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example Mini-Modules</h2>
<p>Modules developed using materials in this Cell Lineage Module.</p>
<h2>4D Development</h2>
<p>The primarily learning divive is to help students understand development happens in space (3-dimensional) and time (3D + time = 4-dimensional).</p>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Major concept:&nbsp;Development happens in space (3-Dimension) plus time (4-D). This include 3-D and 4-D in development&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub-concepts:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
   <li>Cells/embryos have depth – 3 dimensions</li>
   <li>Axes of body plan : A/P, dorsal/ ventral, (left and right: not as crucial, can be reversed))&nbsp;</li>
   <li>In early embryogenesis, the mass of an embryo does not change (while cell number increases) during an embryo’s development&nbsp;</li>
   <li>Embryo vs. stem cell (a multi-potential cell)</li>
</ul>
<p>Time required:&nbsp;Approximately six hours class time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Handouts: (in MS Word format, .doc files)&nbsp;</p>
