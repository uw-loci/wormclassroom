<!-- Cell Lineage Module -->

<p style="text-align: center;">The embryonic cell lineage of <em>C. elegans</em> from zygote to hatched larva</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">provides an excellent tool for learning fundamental principals in developmental biology.</p>

<h2><em>C. elegans</em> Embryogenesis</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Are daughter cells always the same size or can they be different sizes?</li>
   <li>Does cell number increase in the rate of 2 X (1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 16 ---)?</li>
   <li>Why do cells divide at different time?</li>
   <li>Why are the daughter cells different sizes?</li>
   <li>How do cells know where to divide or to go?</li>
   <li>Do all the cells divide?</li>
   <li>Does the embryo grow while its cell number increases?</li>
   <li>Does the size (e.g.: volume) of a mother cell equal to the sum of its two daughter cells? (You might want to use measurement tools, such as <a title="ImageJ website: opens in new window" href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" target="_blank">ImageJ</a>, for comparison.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Human Family Tree</h2>
<ol>
   <li>What is a human family tree?</li>
   <li>What does your family tree look like ?</li>
   <li>What can you discover from your family tree?</li>
   <li>How is your family tree different or similar to another person's family tree?</li>
   <li>Are you any different, in terms of development, from your ancestors?</li>
</ol>
<h2><em>C. elegans</em> Cell Lineage</h2>
<ol>
   <li>What does the lineage (family tree) look like for each focal plane?</li>
   <li>Does a cell always have the same neighbors and how important this might be in its development?</li>
   <li>Why is the cell lineage/cell pattern of lineage the way it is?</li>
   <li>Does a specific cell always appear at around the same time (or location) in every embryo?</li>
   <li>Which of the daughter cells divides first?</li>
   <li>Why are two daughter cells unequal size after cell division?</li>
   <li>Why do the edges of the cells wiggle so much?</li>
   <li>When is a cell’s fate determined?</li>
   <li>How are different cell types generated?</li>
   <li>How does a cell know where to divide or where to go?</li>
   <li>Do all <em>C. elegans</em> embryos divide and develop in a similar fashion? How important is it to have similar or different developmental patterns?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Family Tree vs. Cell Lineage</h2>
<ol>
   <li>What might be the similarities and differences between your family tree and a cell's family tree?</li>
   <li>Are the successor daughter cells in the <em>C. elegans</em> embryo developmentally more differentiated then their predecessors?</li>
   <li>Developmentally, are you more advanced/specified/differentiated than your grandparents?</li>
   <li>How do the fully differentiated cells, such as intestinal cells differ from their mother cell?</li>
</ol>
