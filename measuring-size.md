[[You]{style="color: #000000;"}]{style="color: #009f00;"} might have
questions regarding the embryos\' size (or any kinds of size problems)
during embryognesis. This page provides you a chance to investigate your
questions. [NIH image (for Mac) and Scion (for
PC)](https://imagej.nih.gov/nih-image/about.html) are programs that
allow you to measure the size of an object, gather data from that
object, and export data to other programs to plot a graph. Other
functions of these programs can be found in the users\' manual of these
two programs.

Cells are measured in [micrometres/microns
(µm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micrometre).

 

Wild type - Size: 55 (µm in width) X 30 (µm in height), Magnification:
1000X

Mutant 1 - Size: 55 (µm in width) X 30 (µm in height), Magnification:
1000X

Mutant 2 - Size: 55 (µm in width) X 30 (µm in height), Magnification:
1000X

Mutant 3 - Size: 55 (µm in width) X 30 (µm in height), Magnification:
1000X

Mutant 4 - Size: 55 (µm in width) X 30 (µm in height), Magnification:
1000X

Capturing Images with NIH image (Mac)
-------------------------------------

1.  Use apple+shift+3 to capture your working screen.
2.  It will be saved in HD as picture1 or 2 or - as a simple text file.
    So if you can not find it, use \"Find\" and type in \"picture\"
    (without quote) to find it.
3.  Open this image and select the part you want and copy it.
4.  Open NIH images. Then \"New\" a page that is under \"File\", paste.
5.  Now we have the image in the program -NIH image.
6.  According to what you would like to do, use NIH image manual to do
    it step by step.

If you have QuickTime Pro, follow these steps:

### Capturing Images with Scion (PC)

1.  Use any kinds of screen capture to capture the image and bring it to
    Scion.
2.  Or if you have QuickTime Pro in your own computer, you can download
    the movie. Then play the movie in your desktop computer. You can use
    \"export\" to export a desired image and open it in NIH image to
    measure it.
