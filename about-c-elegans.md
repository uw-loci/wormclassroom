### *C. elegans*: the worm

*C. elegans* is a free-living, non-parasitic soil nematode that can be
found throughout the world. It is transparent and about 1mm in size.
\"Worm\" is its nickname. Researchers working with *C. elegans* call
themselves \"worm people\" and form the \"worm community\" of research.

### Why Study *C. elegans*?

Why study *C. elegans* over other more advanced organisms? The two main
reasons are commonalities with other organisms, and ease of operation.

### *C. elegans* as a Model Organism

Organisms like *C. elegans* are known as model organisms because they
can be used to closely study and elucidate our understanding of basic
biological phenomena that might not be easily researched in other
organisms. *C. elegans* was first selected by Sydney Brenner for study
for its properties as a model organism.

### Other Common Model Organisms

As you might guess, there are various model organisms used to study
different biological phenomena. For instance, prokaryotic model
organisms (e.g. *E. coli*) are useful for understanding other
prokaryotic organisms (e.g. bacteria) that are often valuable in human
disease research.

### Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2002

Acknowledging the completion of *C. elegans* cell lineage and
accompanying research in cell death, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine 2002 was awarded to three *C. elegans* researchers that
contributed to the \"understanding of genetic regulation of organ
development and programmed cell death\" \[fn\][Press
